## `Welcome to Night Owl`

Night Owl is the brainchild of three General Assembly Students Aaron Rascon, Brian Kelly, and Austin Ferrin. In the time of Covid we wanted to be able to bring people together on a purly social platform away from work video calls and madding family group chats you never wanted to be a part of. Night Owl is an App that allows you and your friends to be able to watch anything on Youtube and chat with eachother in real time. It has a retro feel in nature and is here for you endless viewing needs. Please feel free to visit <a href="https://seir629-nightowl.herokuapp.com/">Night Owl</a>

### `Planning`

Night Owl started their planning using <a href="https://trello.com/b/tb68wuwn/youtube-react">Trello</a> to get the main goals down. Also involved in the planning stage were some rough wire frames from Lucid Chats to find placement of components and flow.

### `Unsolved Problems`

We wanted to be able to select an individual video by the index and remove it from the video Que but due to some functionality we are not currently able to. 


### `Future Enhancements`

One feature for our stretch goals was to be able to highlight the background of the current or active video.
